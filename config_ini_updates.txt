max_tokens = 125
max_response_sentences = 2
temperature = 0.5
pause_threshold = 2

...note the max_tokens is for response output not whole convo, so, 125 tokens, used to be around 95 characters, but I was noticing 1 token a word generation, so it probably needs to be lower still, this will be investigated. It will use make 2 sentence response, temp is low soes to stay on topic, and the pause threshold so you dont get cut-off when talking.
