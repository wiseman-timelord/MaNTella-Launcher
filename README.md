> Bring Skyrim and Fallout 4 NPCs to life with AI

### Work Intended:
- Improve scripts for optimize data dynamically in online/offline, this will require 3 versions of the characters info and prompts.
- Additionally, improve the program to process the characters sheet, and process the csv file appropriately, 5sentences/10sentences/Original for =4096/=>8192/=online.
- Also a review and improvement of the convo prompts, how it works in v12, and how to implement my v11 compatible prompts. using my own prompts would be for offline, because they are concise, more effective too, but I am not testing online, so..
